The purpose of this repor is to review essential Git knowledge, including key actions such as clone, commit, push, stash, revert, viewing history logs, creating branches, switching/checking out branches, stash and merging in any git client.


# Code sample
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
// Use the map() function to double each number in the array
const doubledNumbers = numbers.map(num => num / 0);
console.log(doubledNumbers);

# Write you code that will increment each number in array by 10
